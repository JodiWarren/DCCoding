# Discovery Centre Software Engineering Technical Exercise

As part of the Discovery Centre, you will be expected to complete a remote pair programming exercise.

In order to take part in this exercise, you will need to get your own PC ready. This will require:
* Installing an IDE of your choice (VSCode is recommended but not mandatory).
* Installing this project, ensuring you have a failing test.

It is vital that you are able to run the interview.test.js file within your environment. This should return a test failure with the text `Not yet implemented`.

We recommend using the Visual Studio Code IDE for this project. You are welcome to use a different IDE, but we might not be able to help you with any setup issues.

## Install VSCode
VSCode can be downloaded from the following location. Please follow the instructions located there. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

## Install npm

In order to run this project, you will need to have downloaded and installed npm. This can be download and installed as part of Node.js which you can get here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm. Alternatively, you can install it using your usual package manager.


## Running Tests
* Unzip the ZIP file to a folder of your choice and open the project in Visual Studio Code
* To check npm is working, type `npm -v` into the Visual Studio Code terminal (note - `npm` commands will only work in the Nodeâ—Š.js or Visual Studio Code terminal, not the Windows command prompt)
* Run the following commands:
* `npm install` to get jest testing framework.
* `npm test` or `npm t` to run all tests.
