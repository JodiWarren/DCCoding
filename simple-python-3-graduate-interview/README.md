# Discovery Centre Software Engineering Technical Exercise

As part of the Discovery Centre, you will be expected to complete a remote pair programming exercise.

In order to take part in this exercise, you will need to get your own PC ready. This will require:

* Installing an IDE of your choice (PyCharm is recommended but not mandatory).
* Installing this project, ensuring you have a failing test.

It is vital that you are able to run main.py within your environment (see below). This should return a test failure with the text `not yet implemented`.

We recommend using the PyCharm Community IDE for this project. You are welcome to use a different IDE, but we might not be able to help you with any setup issues.


## Setting up the environment

1.	Download and install the free version of PyCharm community from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
2.	You may also need to download Python itself which can be found here: (ensure it is python v3 or above, such as 3.9.0) https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Running Tests

* Unzip the ZIP file to a folder of your choice, and open the folder in pycharm (click 'open' from the right hand options on the launcher window).
* In the project window on the left hand side, open the folder and check under "external libraries" you have python 3.7.
* Open the main.py file and in the menu bar, click Run->Run.
* Select "main" from the popup (this will run the main.py file).
* A run window should appear at the bottom of the UI with a failing test.
* main.py can now be run in future by clicking the play icon in the top right of the UI.
