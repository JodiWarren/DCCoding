# Discovery Centre Software Engineering Technical Exercise

As part of the Discovery Centre, you will be expected to complete a remote pair programming exercise.

In order to take part in this exercise, you will need to get your own PC ready. This will require:
* Installing an IDE of your choice (IntelliJ is recommended but not mandatory).
* Installing this project, ensuring you have a failing test.

You will need to be able to run the JUnitInterviewTest class within your environment. This should return a test failure with the text `No test written yet`.

We recommend using the IntelliJ IDEA Community IDE for this project. You are welcome to use a different IDE, but we might not be able to help you with any setup issues.

## Installing Intellij

### Java â€“ IntelliJ IDEA Community

* Navigate to: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ or search for IntelliJ IDEA in your search engine and click on the first link which should be labelled: IntelliJ IDEA: The Java IDE for Professional Developers
* Click the download button on the website, select the relevant Operating System and select the free Community edition to download
* Run the IntelliJ IDEA installer and follow the prompts to install the IDE.
* Restart your computer if prompted to do so

## Installing the code template

To get setup with Intellij IDE:
* Extract the Zip into a directory.
* Open Intellij and select import project or File -> New -> "Project from existing source".
* Choose the directory this project was unzipped into.
* Choose a relevant project name (e.g. assessment) and choose next.
* Deselect all source directories and click next.
* Make sure you have selected a suitable JDK for the project (this can be either JDK 8 or later).
* Click import gradle (bottom right hand corner of the application).
* Open the JUnitInterviewTest class
* Run it
* The test should fail with the error - `No test yet written`.
